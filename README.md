# Trafic_Pannels_recognition

## Introduction

Welcome to the Traffic Panels Recognition project! This repository contains code and resources for the development of a road sign classification system. The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and accurate system that can recognize and classify various road signs commonly found on the streets.

## Project Overview

In today's world, road safety is of utmost importance, and one crucial aspect of it is the proper recognition of traffic signs. This project aims to address this issue by building a machine learning model that can identify and classify traffic signs accurately. The system will be designed to work with images or videos and provide real-time recognition and classification of traffic signs.

## Features

- Robust Traffic Sign Detection: The system is designed to detect traffic signs in various conditions, including different lighting, weather, and traffic situations.
- Multi-Class Classification: The model can classify traffic signs into different categories, such as speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and more.
- Real-Time Recognition: The system can process images or videos in real-time, making it suitable for applications in autonomous vehicles or traffic management systems.
- User-Friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface is provided to interact with the system, making it easy to use and deploy.

## Data Description :
The heart of any machine learning project is the data. In this repository, we have gathered a dataset that includes 50 images for each of the three road sign classes mentioned above: Avertissement de Danger, Interdiction ou Restriction, and Obligation. The dataset has been meticulously curated to ensure diversity and representation of various road signs within each class.

## System Architecture
A shape recognition system typically consists of three essential modules after data acquisition: preprocessing, feature generation, and classification/decision-making. Here is an overview of how these modules fit into our project:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
The first step in the system is data preprocessing. In this module, we clean and prepare the raw image data to ensure it is in a suitable format for feature extraction and model training. Preprocessing may include tasks such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset to increase diversity.

### 2. Feature Generation
The feature generation module is responsible for extracting relevant features from the preprocessed images. These features are crucial for training a machine learning model. Common techniques for feature extraction in image classification tasks include methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and feature descriptors.

### 3. Classification/Decision
The final module involves training a classification model to recognize road signs based on the extracted features. The model is trained on the preprocessed and feature-enriched data. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be used for this classification task. The choice of the model will depend on the project's requirements and dataset size.
